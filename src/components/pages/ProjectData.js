    tagline: 'Adapting to a remote, online world with interactive demonstration tools for physical products.',
    introduction: 'Vitro View enables and enriches presentation and demonstration of physical products that would otherwise require in-person contact. I found the challenge of building rewarding, traditionally in-person customer experiences in a remote context intriguing, and so I took on Vitroâ€™s design competition.',
    problem: 'COVID-19 has changed the way in which we connect and interact with each other. Vitro has had to end all in-person product demonstrations, essential parts of its business in offering stylized glass products for luxury cosmetics corporations.',
    solution: 'Digitize the customer experience of inspecting and appraising luxury products. Vitro View is a desktop, website application that enables and enriches presentation and demonstration of physical products that would otherwise require in-person contact. Through the interactive website, clients can pan and rotate products 360 degrees at high fidelity, as well as toggle a variety of lighting options, to simulate the attention to detail and precision necessary for luxury cosmetic corporations.',

Reimagining a universal activity to address a rapidly changing world felt like a necessary and exciting challenge, and so I dived into this project so build a better, safer experience.',
